# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The goal of this project was to create a relational database using six provided CSV tables. From there, Postgres and PgAdmin4 were the tools used to filter the data into subsets that could be used to answer questions regarding the status of outgoing retirees within Pewlett-Hackard.
## Results
First, a physical ERD was constructed as a reference point for database construction using the URL-based application, Quick DBD.

With this outline serving as a foundation, PgAdmin4 was used to house our CSV files and query the data as requested.
